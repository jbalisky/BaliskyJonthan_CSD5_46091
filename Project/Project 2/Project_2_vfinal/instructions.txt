**           You have to guess numbers that are between 0-9 within 9 guesses!              **
**              First select either easy or normal. easy = 3 numbers normal = 4            **
**   			First type in three or four numbers as your guess                  **
**        Then the game will show you the amount of Os and Xs you have for that guess.     **
**   An O means that one of your numbers is correct but it is in the wrong position        **
**       An X means that you have a number correct and in the right possition!             **
**   So guess away! But remember you only have 9 guess. Run out of guesses and you lose.   **
**                   Do you have what it takes? Can you decode the sequence?               **
**                                   We will soon find out...;)                            **
